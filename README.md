# DESCRIPTION
This Java program fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on a user-input city name. It first prompts the user to enter the city, then constructs an API request URL using the provided API key. The program makes an HTTP GET request to retrieve the weather details in JSON format. It reads and displays the response, which contains temperature, humidity, and other weather conditions. Error handling is implemented to manage incorrect city names or connectivity issues. To securely store the API key, users should use environment variables instead of hardcoding it in the source code.
